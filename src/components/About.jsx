                Hello! I'm a first-year student at the University of British Columbia, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science.  
                Originally from Alberta, I have always played sports such as, basketball, volleyball, and badminton. 
                A fun fact about meâ€” I once got the opportunity to travel to Hawaii for a volleyball 
                tournament, which was an unforgettable experience! I also have done competitve robotices, getting provinical placements and also
                the opportunity to travel to Dallas, TX for the Robotics World Championship.

            </div>
            <p>
                Outside of sports, I have a strong passion for traveling. I love exploring new 
                places, experiencing different cultures, and seeing how people live around the world. 
                Whether it's a road trip or an overseas adventure, I find joy in discovering new 
                environments and perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also deeply interested in technology and problem-solving. Coding has become 
                one of my favorite ways to challenge myself, and I enjoy building creative solutions 
                to complex problems. I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.
