                                Hello! I'm a first-year student at the University of British Columbia, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science.  
                                Originally from Alberta, I have always played sports such as basketball, volleyball, and badminton.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A fun fact about meâ€” I once got the opportunity to travel to Hawaii for a volleyball 
                                tournament, which was an unforgettable experience! I also have done competitive robotics, getting provincial placements and also
                                the opportunity to travel to Dallas, TX for the Robotics World Championship.
                            </p>

                                I'm also deeply interested in technology and problem-solving. Coding has become 
                                one of my favorite ways to challenge myself, and I enjoy building creative solutions 
                                to complex problems. I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.
                            </p>
